            <p> Welcome to the official website of the Federal Government College
            Ikot Ekpene Class of 1988. More than just an alumni group, we are a
            close-knit community bound by shared experiences, lifelong
            friendships, and a commitment to excellence. Over the years, we have
            grown into a network of professionals, leaders, and changemakers
            across various industries, united by our desire to stay connected
            and give back. Through reunions, mentorship programs, and community
            initiatives, we continue to uphold the values instilled in us during
            our time at FGC Ikot Ekpene. Whether you’re looking to reconnect,
            collaborate, or contribute, this platform is your home. Together, we
            celebrate our past, embrace the present, and shape the
            future—because true bonds last a lifetime.</p>
